# Loop Mode

:::caution Suggestion

Loop mode If you move to Clone SlideItem, you need to wait for the animation(moveTime) to end before you can press NavButton
:::

You can use this mode if you want to repeat continuous sliding items

```tsx
<BearCarousel 
    // ...ignore some 
    isEnableLoop
/>
```

You can slide to end then to next

<Carousel
    staticHeight="250px"
    isEnableLoop
    isDebug
/>
