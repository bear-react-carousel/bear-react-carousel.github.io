# Height

:::caution Suggestion

It is recommended to use a static height, although the auto height is very convenient, but it will cause bad visual effects, flashing to open the layout
:::


## Static Height
You can use your own units **like px, rem, %**

```tsx
<BearCarousel
    // ...ignore some 
    height="250px"
/>
```

<Carousel/>

## Aspect Ratio Height

If you want to set the height proportionally, you can do

```tsx
<BearCarousel 
    // ...ignore some 
    height={{ widthRatio: 21, heightRatio: 9 }}
/>
```

You can move the window to see

<Carousel
    height={{ widthRatio: 21, heightRatio: 9 }}
/>
