<Carousel
    slidesPerView={3}
/>

### Show half

:::tip Tip

You can also use it with `isCenteredSlides` to achieve good results.

Decimals can be set to display half of the picture. This display method is calculated by CSS Flexbox.





```tsx
<BearCarousel
    // ...ignore some
    slidesPerView={1.5}
/>
```


<Carousel
    slidesPerView={1.5}
/>



## Auto



:::tip Tip

You can also use it with `isCenteredSlides` to achieve good results.

:::


If each of your carousel items is a fixed-size Card, but you don't want to change the Card Size because of the container size, you can use `auto`

```tsx
<BearCarousel
    // ...ignore some 
    slidesPerView="auto"
/>
```


<Carousel
    data={imageData}
    slidesPerView="auto"
/>
